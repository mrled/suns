Where we could take this in the future.

## Domain tools

* Show flips, mirrors, reverses, upside downs, etc
* Punycode URLs that resolve anything to a static page, to test how browsers render URLs in the bar
* Find words that start/end/contain a substring

## Webring

Get a webring with some simple graphics and a button that takes you to a random owner's site.

## Make a game

- Inspired by <https://ipv4.games> (also separate implementation at <https://ipv4.quest>)
  - To be really inspired by this, it should be submitted via DNS queries
  - Maybe that is a future version, or a different mode...
    webhooks are useful for now because they're much more natural for webring purposes
- Assign points to each type of flip
  - Probably have to limit one type per domain or something,
    since you could make infinite palindromes off a single domain name.
  - Give more points for very short or very long flips
- Have users set a unique identifier in their TXT record
- Add a leaderboard for who is winning
