The Society for Universal Name Symmetry is a club open to anyone with a symmetric DNS name.

DNS name symmetry can be achieved in several ways.
For instance, this domain name is `zq.suns.bz` which is a Single 180° Flip,
because `zq.su` is `ns.bz` flipped 180 degrees.
See the [symmetries]({{< ref "symmetries" >}}) page for a list of what we support with more examples.
