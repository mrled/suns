title = "This could be a game"
+++

- Inspired by <https://ipv4.games> (also separate implementation at <https://ipv4.quest>)
  - To be really inspired by this, it should be submitted via DNS queries
  - Maybe that is a future version, or a different mode...
    webhooks are useful for now because they're much more natural for webring purposes
- Assign points to each type of flip
  - Probably have to limit one type per domain or something,
    since you could make infinite palindromes off a single domain name.
  - Give more points for very short or very long flips
- Have users set a unique identifier in their TXT record
- Add a leaderboard for who is winning
